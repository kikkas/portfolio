    During the early pilots we discovered that kanban type task
    boards are good for getting an overview of the project status
    but they donâ€™t work well for making sure that workload is equally
    balanced. Managing large teams can be quite challenging  in a workplace,
    such as an entire apartment building where face-to-face interactions are
    rare between the manager and the team. To satisfy both needs we had to
    find better ways to present the data.
